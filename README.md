Firstly you should download dataset_PAF.pkl from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G5uFIGllmJIk05G1Acp2IItjK159XQhC/view?usp=sharing then move it to datasets folder.  
   After that you have to run signalprocess by [python signalprocess_1ch.py]
Then you should run the search for the beast architecture by [python search_1ch_3class.py]
In final step retrain the best architecture by [python retrain3class.py]
